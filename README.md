# DataFrame Wrangling

This repository contains a notebook serving as a quick reference for popular DataFrame wrangling operations using Pandas and Polars libraries, aimed at users switching between these libraries. While Pandas and Polars have comprehensive self-contained documentation, this notebook focuses on common data wrangling tasks in data science workflows.

Additionally, there's a Python script demonstrating basic data wrangling using the HuggingFace datasets library, which employs a DatasetDict structure. This structure, while less flexible and familiar than Pandas, is essential for working with Transformer models and the HuggingFace ecosystem. It provides conversion functionality for switching between DatasetDict and DataFrame structures, enabling complex operations in the DataFrame format before returning to a DatasetDict structure for downstream modeling.
